<p class= "w3-large"> Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s One Hundred Years of Solitude follows generations of the Buendia family.  We see that generations of men in the family are named either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano, inevitably causing readers to confuse all the different Jose Arcadio storylines and the different Aureliano storylines. For female family members, we see that the names Amaranta and Remedios are repeated over generations. As a reader, it was often difficult to keep track of the distinct people and relationships without continually referring back to the family tree at the front of the English version of the book.</p>

<p class="w3-large"> Many characters share the same name, repeating the actions of their predecessors. We question whether the author actually expects the reader to keep track of every single person as they read the book, especially because the characters themselves are self-aware of the repetition. Ursula notices that “throughout the long history of the family the insistent repetition of names had made her draw some conclusions that seemed to be certain. While the Aurelianos were withdrawn, but with lucid minds, the Jose Arcadios were impulsive and enterprising, but they were marked with a tragic sign” (181).  These traits are maintained during the narrative; the Jose Arcadios are marked by irrational impulsiveness and hedonistic desires. For instance, Ursula’s son Jose Arcadio runs with the gypsies and traveling the globe, and Jose Arcadio Segundo rescues Fernanda from a massacre. In addition, they have an overriding desire for physical pleasure and women. In addition, the Aurelianos are more intellectual, quiet, and clear-minded. We see that Colonel Aureliano invests heavily in leading the war efforts over many years, later committing to the solitary practice of crafting gold fishes.</p>

<p class="w3-large"> The vices of family members may pass down over generations. An example of this is the "hereditary vice of making something just to unmake it" (382). Amaranta fixates on weaving her funeral shroud, and “It might have been said that she wove during the day and unwove during the night, and not with any hope of defeating solitude in that way, but, quite the contrary, in order to nurture it” (259). We see that Amaranta Ursula keeps busy by "resolving domestic problems that she herself had created...doing a poor job on a thousand things which she would fix on the following day with a pernicious diligence that made one think of Fernanda." Lastly, Colonel Aureliano is fixated on making little gold fishes. He forges fish after fish, only to later melt them down and make them all over again. He continues this pattern of obsessive, repetitive behavior until he dies.</p>

<p class="w3-large"> In addition, we realize that not only do many characters share the same name across generations, repeating the actions of their predecessors, but many characters often repeat the same actions throughout their day to day lives. Ursula in her old age observes this as she watches her family mill about. Her family members "never took her by surprise, and after some time she discovered that every member of the family, without realizing it, repeated the same path every day, the same actions, and almost repeated the same words at the hour" (247).</p>

<p class="w3-large"> Due to the persistent patterns, cycles, and repetitions in this book, I thought that textual analysis would yield very interesting results. I’m most interested the relationships between the characters, the dispersion of certain themes (love, life, solitude, time, war) throughout the novel, and understanding which words are associated with different characters.</p>
