<p class= "w3-large"> Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude </i>follows generations of the Buendia family.  We see that generations of men in the family are named either Jose Arcadio or Aureliano, inevitably causing readers to confuse all the different Jose Arcadio storylines and the different Aureliano storylines. For female family members, we see that the names Amaranta and Remedios are repeated over generations. As a reader, it was often difficult to keep track of the distinct people and relationships without continually referring back to the family tree at the front of the English version of the book.</p>

<p class="w3-large"> Many characters share the same name, repeating the actions of their predecessors. We question whether the author actually expects the reader to keep track of every single person as they read the book, especially because the characters themselves are self-aware of the repetition. Ursula notices that “throughout the long history of the family the insistent repetition of names had made her draw some conclusions that seemed to be certain. While the Aurelianos were withdrawn, but with lucid minds, the Jose Arcadios were impulsive and enterprising, but they were marked with a tragic sign” (181).  These traits are maintained during the narrative; the Jose Arcadios are marked by irrational impulsiveness and hedonistic desires. For instance, Ursula’s son Jose Arcadio runs with the gypsies and traveling the globe, and Jose Arcadio Segundo rescues Fernanda from a massacre. In addition, they have an overriding desire for physical pleasure and women. In addition, the Aurelianos are more intellectual, quiet, and clear-minded. We see that Colonel Aureliano invests heavily in leading the war efforts over many years, later committing to the solitary practice of crafting gold fishes.</p>

<p class="w3-large"> The vices of family members may pass down over generations. An example of this is the "hereditary vice of making something just to unmake it" (382). Amaranta fixates on weaving her funeral shroud, and “It might have been said that she wove during the day and unwove during the night, and not with any hope of defeating solitude in that way, but, quite the contrary, in order to nurture it” (259). We see that Amaranta Ursula keeps busy by "resolving domestic problems that she herself had created...doing a poor job on a thousand things which she would fix on the following day with a pernicious diligence that made one think of Fernanda." Lastly, Colonel Aureliano is fixated on making little gold fishes. He forges fish after fish, only to later melt them down and make them all over again. He continues this pattern of obsessive, repetitive behavior until he dies.</p>

<p class="w3-large"> In addition, we realize that not only do many characters share the same name across generations, repeating the actions of their predecessors, but many characters often repeat the same actions throughout their day to day lives. Ursula in her old age observes this as she watches her family mill about. Her family members "never took her by surprise, and after some time she discovered that every member of the family, without realizing it, repeated the same path every day, the same actions, and almost repeated the same words at the hour" (247).</p>

<p class="w3-large"> Due to the persistent patterns, cycles, and repetitions in this book, I thought that textual analysis would yield very interesting results. I’m most interested the relationships between the characters and understanding which words are associated with different characters.</p>

    <div class="w3-col w3-padding-large">
      <h1 class="w3-center">Character Relation Graph</h1><br>
 
<p class= "w3-large">We can model relationships between characters using an undirected graph. Each vertex in the graph represents a different character, and the color of the vertex corresponds to the degree of the vertex. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges emanating from it. Warmer color vertices have higher degrees, and cooler color vertices have fewer degrees. The edges between vertices represent relationships. To automate detecting whether two character have a relationship, we operate on the assumption that if character X and character Y are mentioned within 30 words of each other, then they have a relationship. Thus, the number of edges that emanate from a particular vertex represent the number of relationships a particular character has.</p>

<p class="w3-large"> Somewhat unsurprisingly, the vertex with the highest degree is Ursula. We realize that this is reasonable because she is alive for the longest amount of time during the novel, thus allowing her to meet future generations of her family, as well as other inhabitants of Macondo. In addition, we see women like Amaranta and Remedios as central, as well. In addition, we see that character who are introduced later in the book to have lower degree vertices as well. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-center">Word Associations</h1><br>

<p class= "w3-large">I was interested in determing which words are frequently associated with certain characters names or certain themes in <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>. In order to determine these words, I used Skipgram Word2Vector embedding. I trained a simple neural network model described <a href= http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/>here</a> to learn probabilities of target-context word pairs. The major takeaway is that training a model on the text of this book will allow us to construct a 250-dimensional vector for every word in the book. </p>

<p class="w3-large"> Now that we have vector representations of all the words in the book, we can take the vector of a target word and find 20 vectors that are closest to it by using the Euclidean distance metric, i.e. the nearest neighbors to this vector. These 20 closest vectors correspond to words that are often found near target word. Note that we preprocessed the text of the book to remove common "stop words," such as "is, was, would, didnt..."</p>

<p class="w3-large"> The plot below is somewhat hard to read, but it represents all the 100-dimensional word vectors squashed to two-dimensions. I've also generated word clouds for major characters and themes. Full nearest neighbors results can be found <a href=https://github.com/roshni714/weird-americas/blob/master/word_associations.txt >here</a>; I've generated them for every word of the book. </p>

<p class= "w3-large"> Word cloud for the word "men" and "women" side by side. I was surprised to see that both men and women had the word "murmured" come up as a commonly associated word. We also see this word come up when we look at the word clouds of specific characters and especially the female ones; it seems to suggest that it was a common way of describing how people speak one on one in the dialogue. We also see a lot of words associated with sadness and solitude on the women's side, such as "lamented," "sigh," and "lonely." In contrast, for men, "property" and "wives" were two prominent words. It's somewhat unsurprising to see "property" on the men side and not the women because men have power and ownership of their property and often their wives. In addition, words associated with the war come up in the men's word cloud, which also makes sense because the revolution, war, and political conflicts in the book were carried out by men. </p>

<p class= "w3-large"> Word cloud for the word "Aureliano" and "Colonel" side by side. The word cloud of "Colonel" is filled with words that relate to politics, war, and revolution; this makes a lot of sense because the word-vector embedding not only represents which words are close to "Colonel Aureliano Buendia," but also words that are close to "Colonel Gerineldo," or any colonel in the war. In contrast, in the Aureliano word cloud, we not only see war-related words, but we see "manuscripts," "sighed," and "routine," which indicate the thoughtful and intellectual side of the Aurelianos. For example, the last Aureliano decodes Melquiades' manuscripts generations, which reveals every fortune and misfortune lived by the Buendia family. </p>

 </div> 

 <p class= "w3-large"> Word cloud for the word "Ursula" and "Remedios" side by side. Remedios is always referred as "Remedios the Beauty," so it's unsurprising to see "beauty" as one of the largest words in the Remedios word cloud.

  </div>
 </div> 

 <p class= "w3-large"> Word cloud for the word "Melquiades" and "Gypsy" side by side. The words "extraordinary," "audience," "enthusiastic," and "shown" likely refer to the magical inventions and demonstrations that the gypsies bring to Macondo. For Melquiades' word cloud, we see that "manuscripts," "metals," and "arcadio" make sense because they refer to Melquiades' influence on the original Jose Arcadio Buendia.
