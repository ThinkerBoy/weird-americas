  knew much certainty location everything forgot blind times
  one occasion fernanda whole house upset lost wedding ring rsula found shelf childrens bedroom
  quite simply others going carelessly watched four senses never took surprise time discovered every member family without realizing repeated path every day actions almost repeated words hour
  deviated meticulous routine run risk losing something
  heard fernanda upset cause lost ring rsula remembered thing different done day put mattresses sun meme found bedbug might before

  even though trembling hands noticeable weight feet much small figure never seen many places time
  almost diligent whole weight house shoulders
  nevertheless impenetrable solitude decrepitude clairvoyance examined insignificant happenings family first time saw clearly truths busy life former times prevented seeing
  around time preparing jos arcadio seminary already made detailed recapitulation life house since founding macondo completely changed opinion always held descendants
  realized colonel aureliano buenda lost love family hardened war thought never loved anyone even wife remedios countless onenight women passed life much less sons
  sensed fought many wars idealism everyone thought renounced certain victory fatigue everyone thought lost reason pure sinful pride
  reached conclusion son given life simply man incapable love
  one night carrying belly heard weeping

  people predicted prophet
  hand shuddered certainty deep moan first indication fearful pig tail begged god let child die womb
  lucidity old age allowed see said many times cries children mothers wombs announcements ventriloquism faculty prophecy unmistakable sign incapacity love
  lowering image son brought compassion owed him
  amaranta however whose hardness heart frightened whose concentrated bitterness made bitter suddenly became clear final analysis tender woman ever existed understood pitying clarity unjust tortures submitted pietro crespi dictated desire vengeance everyone thought slow martyrdom frustrated life colonel gerineldo mrquez determined gall bitterness everyone thought actions mortal struggle measureless love invincible cowardice irrational fear amaranta always tormented heart triumphed end
  time rsula began speak rebecas name bringing back memory old love exalted tardy repentance sudden admiration coming understand rebeca one never fed milk earth land whiteness walls one carry blood veins unknown blood strangers whose bones still clocing grave
